# PauliPropagation.jl
`PauliPropagation.jl` is a Julia package for Pauli propagation simulation of quantum circuits and quantum systems.

The package estimates expectation values of observables expressed in the Pauli basis under evolution of noiseless and noisy quantum circuits. For example,  $`Tr[\rho \mathcal{D}(\hat{O})]`$ where $`\hat{O}`$ is an observable that is preferably sparse in Pauli basis, $`\mathcal{D}`$ is a quantum circuit, and $`\rho`$ a quantum state. For the case of unitary quantum circuits $`U`$, this is commonly written as $`Tr[\rho U^\dagger \hat{O} U]`$.


## Installation

The `PauliPropagation.jl` package is not yet registered. But you can install it in at least the following two ways:

### Install from GitHub
You can install the package using `Pkg` from the following link: `https://github.com/MSRudolph/PauliPropagation.jl.git`.\
For example, if you are working with a Jupyter notebook, run
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/MSRudolph/PauliPropagation.jl.git")
```
where you can use the keyword `rev="branchname"` to install the version on a particular branch if you want to contribute to the package.

### Clone repository and install locally 
Navigate to a local directory where you want to clone this repository into and run the following in a terminal
```bash
git clone git@github.com:MSRudolph/PauliPropagation.jl.git
```
Inside this cloned repository you can now freely import `PauliPropagation` or install it into your environment.\
Alternatively, you can push the relative path to the cloned repository to the Julia package load path called `LOAD_PATH` via
```julia
rel_path = "your/relative/path/PauliPropagation"
push!(LOAD_PATH,rel_path);
```

## Examples

You can find example notebooks in the `examples` folder.

Here is a tiny working example where we approximately simulate the expectation value of a quantum circuit.
```julia
using PauliPropagation

## number of qubits
nqubits = 32

## define the observable
# here I...IZI...I
observable = PauliString(nqubits, :Z, 16)

## define the circuit
# the number of layers
nlayers = 32

# bricklayertopology is also the default if you don't provide any
topology = bricklayertopology(nqubits; periodic=true)

# a circuit containing RX and RZZ Pauli gates on the topology
# derived from the Trotterization of a transverse field Ising Hamiltonian
circuit = tfitrottercircuit(nqubits, nlayers; topology=topology)

# time step
dt = 0.1
# count the number of parameters
nparams = countparameters(circuit)
# define the parameter vector
parameters = ones(nparams) * dt

## the truncations
# maximum Pauli weight
max_weight = 6
# minimal coefficient magnitude
min_abs_coeff = 1e-4

## propagate through the circuit with our best (and currently only propagation method)
pauli_sum = propagate(circuit, observable, parameters; max_weight=max_weight, min_abs_coeff=min_abs_coeff)

## overlap with the initial state
overlapwithzero(pauli_sum)
# yields 0.154596728241...
```

## Important Notes and Caveats
All of the following points can be addressed by you writing the necessary missing code due to the nice extensibility of Julia.
- The package is tested for Julia `1.10`.
- The default is the Heisenberg _backpropagation_ (with Schrödinger propagation coming soon).
- We currently do not support the strong simulation of quantum states in non-exponential time (even for Stabilizer states).
- Sampling quantum states is currently not supported.
- Many underlying data structures and functions can be used for other purposes involving Pauli operators.

## Upcoming Features
This package is still work-in-progress. You will probably find certain features that you would like to have and that are currently missing.\
Here are some features that we want to implement in the future. Feel free to contribute!
- **A documentation website!**
- **Easier Schrödinger picture propagation**. Currently, the default is Heisenberg and there is no easy way to transpose the gates.
- **Gates with several parameters**. Currently, each parametrized gate takes exactly one parameter. Multi-parameter gates have to be decomposed.
- **A fast and flexible Surrogate version**. Currently, we provide a version of the Pauli propagation Surrogate that is _good_ and _works_, at least for Pauli gates and Clifford gates. Stay tuned for a whole lot more.

## How to contribute
