# PauliPropagation.jl
`PauliPropagation.jl` is a Julia package for Pauli propagation simulation of quantum circuits and quantum systems.

The package simulates the evolution of objects expressed in the Pauli basis under noiseless and noisy quantum circuits. Commonly, this is used for the Heisenberg picture evolution of an observable. For example, if $`\hat{O}`$ is an observable that is preferably sparse in Pauli basis and $`\mathcal{E}`$ is a quantum circuit, we simulate $`\mathcal{E}^\dagger(\hat{O})`$ instead of most quantum simulation packages simulating the Schrödinger evolution  $`\mathcal{E}(\rho)`$ of states $`\rho`$. For the case of unitary quantum circuits $`U`$, the evolved observable $`\mathcal{E}^\dagger(\hat{O})`$ is usually written like $`U^\dagger \hat{O} U`$.

Some opt-in truncations or approximations are particularly suited for estimating expectation values $`Tr[\rho \mathcal{E}^\dagger(\hat{O})]`$ of evolved observables with quantum states. 


## Installation

The `PauliPropagation.jl` package is registered and can be installed into your environment in the following way:
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("PauliPropagation")
```

### Install from GitHub
If you want to install the latest code, you can install the package directly from the Github link.
For example, if you are working with a Jupyter notebook, run
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/MSRudolph/PauliPropagation.jl.git", rev="branchname")
```
where you can use the keyword `rev="branchname"` to install development versions of the package.
We don't recommend using branches other than `main` or `dev`.

### Clone repository and install locally 
Navigate to a local directory where you want to clone this repository into and run the following in a terminal
```bash
git clone git@github.com:MSRudolph/PauliPropagation.jl.git
```
Inside this cloned repository you can now freely import `PauliPropagation` or install it into your environment.\
Alternatively, you can push the relative path to the cloned repository to the Julia package load path called `LOAD_PATH` via
```julia
rel_path = "your/relative/path/PauliPropagation"
push!(LOAD_PATH,rel_path);
```
This may require that you have no global installation of `PauliPropagation` in your enviroment.

## Examples

You can find example notebooks in the `examples` folder.

Here is a tiny working example where we approximately simulate the expectation value of a quantum circuit.
```julia
using PauliPropagation

## number of qubits
nqubits = 32

## define the observable
# here I...IZI...I
observable = PauliString(nqubits, :Z, 16)

## define the circuit
# the number of layers
nlayers = 32

# bricklayertopology is also the default if you don't provide any
topology = bricklayertopology(nqubits; periodic=true)

# a circuit containing RX and RZZ Pauli gates on the topology
# derived from the Trotterization of a transverse field Ising Hamiltonian
circuit = tfitrottercircuit(nqubits, nlayers; topology=topology)

# time step
dt = 0.1
# count the number of parameters
nparams = countparameters(circuit)
# define the parameter vector
parameters = ones(nparams) * dt

## the truncations
# maximum Pauli weight
max_weight = 6
# minimal coefficient magnitude
min_abs_coeff = 1e-4

## propagate through the circuit with our best (and currently only propagation method)
pauli_sum = propagate(circuit, observable, parameters; max_weight=max_weight, min_abs_coeff=min_abs_coeff)

## overlap with the initial state
overlapwithzero(pauli_sum)
# yields 0.154596728241...
```

## Important Notes and Caveats
All of the following points can be addressed by you writing the necessary missing code due to the nice extensibility of Julia.
- The package is tested for Julia `1.10`.
- The default is the Heisenberg _backpropagation_ (with Schrödinger propagation coming soon).
- We currently do not support the strong simulation of quantum states in non-exponential time (even for Stabilizer states).
- Sampling quantum states is currently not supported.
- Many underlying data structures and functions can be used for other purposes involving Pauli operators.

## Upcoming Features
This package is still work-in-progress. You will probably find certain features that you would like to have and that are currently missing.\
Here are some features that we want to implement in the future. Feel free to contribute!
- **A documentation website!**
- **Easier Schrödinger picture propagation**. Currently, the default is Heisenberg and there is no easy way to transpose the gates.
- **A fast and flexible Surrogate version**. Currently, we provide a version of the Pauli propagation Surrogate that is _good_ and _works_, at least for Pauli gates and Clifford gates. Stay tuned for a whole lot more.
