# This file contains specialized functions for some of our gates.
# We overload `applyandadd!()` to fix potential type-instabilities in `apply()` if the number of returned Pauli strings is not fixed.
# We overload `applytoall!()` to reduce unnecessarily moving Pauli strings between `psum` and `aux_psum`.
# This usually also fixes potential type-instabilities in `apply()`.
# Both functions can be overloaded if needed.
