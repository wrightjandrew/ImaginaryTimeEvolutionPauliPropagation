### paulifreqtracker.jl
##
# PauliFreqTracker type and methods.
# It records the behavior at PauliRotation gates, i.e., the number of times it received a sin or cos factor, and the total number of branchings/splits.
# These path properties can be used for truncations.
# By default, we support `max_freq` and `max_nsins` truncations if the coefficients are of type `PauliFreqTracker`.

"""
    PauliFreqTracker(coeff::Number, nsins::Int, ncos::Int, freq::Int)

Wrapper type for numerical coefficients in Pauli propagation that records 
the number of sin and cos factors applied via a `PauliRotation` gate, and the so-called frequency, which is their sum.
It appears redundant but these three properties need to be tracked separately because of how merging affects them.
