"""
    totransfermap(nq::Integer, circuit::Vector{Gate}, thetas=nothing)

Computes the Pauli transfer map acting on `nq` qubits from a circuit with parameters `thetas`.
`thetas` defaults to `nothing` but is required if the circuit contains parametrized gates.
The returned lookup map is a vector of vectors like [(pstr1, coeff1), (pstr2, coeff2), ...],
where the `pstr` are *partial* Pauli strings on the affected qubits.

    # max integer to feed into the circuit
    max_integer = 4^nq - 1

    # Do one propagation per initial Pauli string on the number of qubits (can be very expensive)
    psums = [propagate(circuit, PauliString(nq, TermType(ii), 1.0), thetas; min_abs_coeff=0) for ii in 0:max_integer]

    # Convert our transfer map style, i.e., vector of vector of tuples

end

"""
    totransfermap(ptm::Matrix)

Computes the Pauli transfer map acting on `nq` qubits from a Pauli Transfer Matrix (PTM).
The PTM should be the matrix representation of a gate in Pauli basis.
The returned lookup map is a vector of vectors like [(pstr1, coeff1), (pstr2, coeff2), ...],
where the `pstr` are *partial* Pauli strings on the affected qubits.
