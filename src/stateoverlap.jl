### This file contains the functions to calculate the overlap between between backpropagated pauli strings and states or general operators.

"""
    overlapbyorthogonality(psum::PauliSum, orthogonalfunc::Function)

Overlap a `PauliSum` with a state or operator via function that returns true if a Pauli string is orthogonal and hence doesn't contribute.
An example `orthogonalfunc` is `containsXorY` which returns true if a Pauli string contains an X or Y Pauli.
If not orthogonal, then a Pauli string contributes with its coefficient.
This is particularly useful for overlaps with stabilizer states.
